# Tripleten PDV

This application was created for studying purposes.

We're going to use HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to build a point of sale (POS, in portuguese PDV) software.

The design used is well described in this [figma file.](https://www.figma.com/file/00zods6GB5lP4o48HwdoP9/PDV?node-id=0:1&t=7OJye74EtojzoyYg-0)

Thanks Thiago Castro for your hard working making this designs available for free. You can check more of his work [right here.](https://thiagocastroux.com/)

## System features

- Create, delete and edit products;
- Add products to an order;
- Change products quantity from the order;
- Register and save the order;
- Filter products depending upon the category;

This project is shared between different cohorts from Tripleten's course.
So, each of them will have a dedicated and separate branch.

## Phases of Development

### Basic Javascript

We start implementing using simple vanilla JS in a procedural way. This first step aims to introduce JS basic syntax, operators, DOM and events.

### Javascript Object Oriented

In this second step, we're going to create a separate branch, keeping all the previous hard work for later comparison, if we wish.

This phase will have two main goals:

- Refactor the code, generating classes to encapsulate all the logic written in previous phase;
- Implement AJAX to persist data server side, using fetch API;
